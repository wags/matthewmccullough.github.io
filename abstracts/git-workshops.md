# The Comprehensive Git and GitHub Two Day Workshop

Distributed version control is all the rage these days, but is it worth it? It has been transformative for the dozens of organizations and thousands of developers that I've mentored on the unique implementation called Git and the associated social coding layers of GitHub. But don't take my word for it. Discover the joy of a version control system that works for you, not against you, in a hands-on workshop. Bring a Windows, Mac, or Linux laptop and we'll install, set up, use and bend Git and GitHub into workflows that weren't even possible with the version control systems of yesteryear. Be prepared to rethink how lightweight, fast, and refreshing source code control can be. After completing the first day of this workshop you'll be able to do practical work with Git for your day job or weekend OSS hobby.

Many one-day Git classes successfully focus on the basics for those new to DVCS. However, with Git having a full 7 years on the street now, there is a growing desire to address the maturing users of this innovative DVCS. Git has established itself as an important new version control system and many progressive developers have already moved to this exciting system. Passionate developers may begin to wonder what advanced features Git has to offer. These advanced Git usages are scarcely documented, and for the first time, they are demonstrated in an easy-to-grasp form with the use case, operation, and behavior all thoroughly explained.

 This two-day Git workshop takes you beyond the basic edit, add, and commit workflow to deep Git features that benefit developers appreciative of what Git's flexible DVCS model brings to hard-core software development. This class will take existing Git users and bring them to a heightened level of productivity by leveraging Git's powerful, yet under-used advanced features. You'll learn how to harvest and inspect commit-specific merges, leverage interactive rebase, and search through history with precision and speed. Tags, GPG signatures, and other cryptographic integrity features will become clear, and pushing and pulling will be controlled with newfound precision.
